This folder contains some complementary material:
  -test_metrics_evaluation.py computes the stylized features and first four moments in evaluation scripts of each model. It is very similiar to the modified test_metrics.py with a slight change in the initial value of the lagged times, here (test_metrics_evaluation.py) the first lagged time is different from zero.
