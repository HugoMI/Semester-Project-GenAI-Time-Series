This folder contains some complementary material:
  - test_metrics_evaluation.py computes the stylized features and first four moments in evaluation scripts of each model. It is very similiar to the modified test_metrics.py with a slight change in the initial value     of the lagged times, here (test_metrics_evaluation.py) the first lagged time is different from zero.
  - data500SP_v1.csv is the raw data from Yahoo! Finance, it contains the hsitorical stock prices of the GOOG stock.
